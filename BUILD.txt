------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building MP4GNN requires CMake 2.8, found at http://www.cmake.org/, as well as
GNU make. Assumming CMake and GNU make are installed, two commands should
suffice to build MP4GNN:

     $ make config
     $ make


Configuration
-------------
MP4GNN is primarily configured by passing options to make config. For
example:

     $ make config shared=1 

would configure MP4GNN to be built as a shared library.

Common configuration options are:
  cc=[compiler]   - The C compiler to use [default is mpicc]
  cxx=[compiler]  - The C++ compiler to use [default is mpicxx]
  shared=1        - Build a shared library instead of a static one 
                    [off by default]
  prefix=[PATH]   - Set the installation prefix [/usr/local/ by default]

Advanced debugging related options:
  gdb=1       - Build with support for GDB [off by default]
  debug=1     - Enable debugging support [off by default]
  assert=1    - Enable asserts [off by default]
  assert2=1   - Enable very expensive asserts [off by default]

Installation
------------
To install MP4GNN, run

    $ make install

The default installation prefix is /usr/local. To pick an installation 
prefix for MP4GNN pass prefix=[path] to make config. For example,

    $ make config prefix=~/myroot/

will cause MP4GNN to be installed in ~/myroot/ when make install is run.


Other make commands
-------------------
   $ make uninstall 
          Removes all files installed by 'make install'.
   
   $ make clean 
          Removes all object files but retains the configuration options.
   
   $ make distclean 
          Performs clean and completely removes the build directory.
